## General Exam Evilness
* ***READ EXAM CODE CAREFULLY***
    * Code formatting is frequently less than could be desired, especially in terms of curly braces and scoping.  ***Watch out for tricky one-line `ifs`, and `for` or `while` loops hidden in poorly formatted code.***
    * Pay attention to line numbers in exam code. ***IF THE CODE BEGINS WITH `1:` AND IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PACKAGE OR IMPORT, THEN THE PACKAGE IS THE DEFAULT, AND THERE ARE NO IMPORTS.*** This may lead to code that will not compile.
